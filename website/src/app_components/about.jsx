                <p>Amidst the pandemic's challenges, I embarked on a journey to learn welding. My initial project, a Colin Furze-style drift trike, introduced me to hands-on fabrication. Yet, it was the subsequent endeavor that truly captured my imagination: the creation of an electrifying go-kart.</p>
                <p>After completing and test-driving the go-kart, a pivotal insight struck me. The lack of instrumentation could potentially lead to avoidable engine failures. This realization motivated me to take on a new challenge â€“ crafting an Arduino-powered dashboard.</p>
                <p>Originally envisioned as a tachometer to measure RPM, the project's scope quickly expanded. The dashboard evolved into a comprehensive tool, displaying real-time speed, calculating distances covered, tracking engine hours, and featuring an advanced two-step rev limiter with launch control. This project epitomizes the fusion of hands-on skill and technical curiosity, symbolizing my transition from a simple tinkerer to an enthusiast embracing technology's potential.</p>
