                    <p>CHASSIS</p>
                    <p>The chassis was made from random bits and pieces of metal I could attain cheaply or freely, mainly 1" square tubing and 1" x 2" tubing. It was stick welded using 6013 rod.</p>

                    <p>ENGINE</p>
                    <p>The original engine was a Honda 270GX 9HP utility engine, which was taken from a gas powered air-compressor. Eventually this was upgraded to a beastly 6-speed motorcycle engine from Honda CBR125. </p>

                    <p>SUSPENSION</p>
                    <p>Although this entire project can be considered &quot;unengineered&quot;, the suspension takes the cake in this department and 4 cool looking (red) springs where purchased. The front set was later replaced with a stiffer pair.</p>

                    <p>BRAKES</p>
                    <p>Initially the go kart was fitted with dual rear disc brakes originall from an italian made pocket bike. Once the CBR engine was installed, the CBR rear brake system was also installed on the go-kart.</p>
